- Now create a new channel in telegram make sure its public and add your bot as an admin to the channel

- In the Software check the telegram notification check box and paste the bot token, in the channel box provide ur channel link name e.g
If ur channel link is t.me/yourchannel
So u put @yourchannel Whenever there is an item in stock it will send a message to ur channel
